# Simple Startup Application Management

Before we start, this was the projects that me and my friend make for making an application startup management program using GOLANG as a backend,
A lightweight console-based application built with Go that allows users to manage startups, team members, and funding information efficiently. 
Ideal for small startup teams or academic purposes, this project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including structs, arrays, sorting, and searching in Go.
